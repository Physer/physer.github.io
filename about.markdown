Hi!

My name is Alex Schouls.

I'm a senior .NET developer focusing on high-availability, high-performing back-end solutions. My favourite stacks and technologies are: .NET, C# and Azure!

Currently I'm employed as a .NET XPRT at [XPRTZ](https://www.xprtz.net/) where I'm working for [De Nederlandsche Bank](https://www.dnb.nl/) as a solution architect for the team responsible for all statistical data. De Nederlandsche Bank is the Dutch [monetary authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank).
