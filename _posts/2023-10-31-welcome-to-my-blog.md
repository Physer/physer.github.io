So this is it. After all these years I guess I'm really doing it huh?
I'm starting a blog!

Welcome to all my ramblings, thoughts and tutorials about coding, software architecture and other technical-related musings.

I hope you guys have fun around here, perhaps I'll be able to teach your a thing or two or we can have some nice discussions about the topics posted here.

Thanks for taking the time to read my blog and I'll see you in the next post!
